# Comprehensive OKR and Task Seeding

This script creates a complete working environment with OKRs and tasks linked together, matching the screenshots exactly.

## What Gets Created

### 4 OKRs with Real Data from Screenshots

1. **AI Fluency OKR** (In Progress, 60%)
   - 4 key results about AI skill development
   - Category: Required AI OKR FY26
   - Includes detailed progress tracking

2. **Install Base Adoption** (In Progress, 62%)
   - 4 key results about renewals and migrations
   - Category: General Business OKR FY26
   - Focus on customer success

3. **XM Cloud Storytelling** (In Progress, 65%)
   - 5 key results about certification and demos
   - Categories: General Business + Required Sales OKR FY26
   - Personal development focus

4. **"dsd"** (Needs Revision, 5%)
   - 2 placeholder key results
   - Category: General Business OKR FY26
   - Needs to be properly defined

### 12 Tasks Linked to OKRs

Tasks are distributed across "To Do" and "In Progress" columns, with each task linked to:
- A specific OKR (`okrId`)
- A specific key result (`keyResultId`)

Examples:
- "Complete AI Advantage self-assessment" → AI Fluency OKR
- "Conduct migration assessment for Beta Industries" → Install Base OKR
- "Complete XM Cloud certification module 4" → XM Cloud OKR

## Usage

```powershell
# Windows PowerShell - Set Firebase credentials
$env:GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="C:\path\to\your\serviceAccountKey.json"

# Run with your email (board will be created automatically)
node data-migration/seed-okrs-with-tasks.js your-email@example.com

# Or specify a custom board name
node data-migration/seed-okrs-with-tasks.js your-email@example.com "Q1 2026 Goals"
```

## What Happens

1. **Board Setup**
   - Creates or finds board named "My OKR Tasks" (or your custom name)
   - Sets up 3 columns: To Do, In Progress, Done

2. **OKR Creation**
   - Deletes any existing OKRs for your user
   - Creates 4 new OKRs with exact data from screenshots
   - Each OKR has 2-5 key results with progress tracking

3. **Task Creation**
   - Creates 12 tasks linked to the OKRs
   - Distributes tasks across To Do and In Progress columns
   - Each task includes time tracking and OKR linkage

4. **Summary Report**
   - Shows what was created
   - Lists all OKRs with their status and progress
   - Provides next steps
